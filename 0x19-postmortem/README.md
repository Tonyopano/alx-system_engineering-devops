Resolution and Recovery
The root cause of the server breakdown and Error 500 responses was identified as a critical hardware failure within the server system. Further investigation is required to determine the specific component that malfunctioned and led to the server failure.

System Reboot: The server was rebooted to attempt a recovery and determine if the issue was temporary.
Diagnostic Tests: Comprehensive diagnostic tests were performed to isolate the root cause of the server breakdown and identify the faulty hardware component.
Vendor Assistance: External assistance was sought from a specialized vendor to expedite the resolution process. Their technicians were dispatched to assist with the repair and replacement of the faulty server component.
Component Replacement: After identifying the faulty component, it was replaced with a new one to restore the server's functionality.
Testing and Validation: Rigorous testing was conducted to ensure the stability and reliability of the server system after the faulty component replacement.
Server Restoration: Once the testing phase was successfully completed, the server was brought back online, and normal operations were restored.

Corrective and Preventive measures
To address the root cause of the incident and prevent similar occurrences in the future, the following corrective and preventive measures will be implemented:

Redundancy and Failover Systems: Implement redundancy and failover mechanisms to ensure service continuity in case of hardware failures.
Regular Maintenance: Establish a regular maintenance schedule to proactively identify and address potential hardware issues before they cause significant disruptions
Enhanced Monitoring and Alerting: Strengthen monitoring systems to detect early signs of hardware failure or performance degradation. Implement timely alerts to enable proactive actions and prevent severe disruptions.
Incident Response Improvements: Enhance incident response procedures and escalation processes to minimize downtime and improve response times during critical incidents.
Documentation and Knowledge Sharing: Maintain comprehensive documentation of incidents and their resolutions to facilitate knowledge sharing within the team and enable faster response and recovery in the future.
Training and Skill Development: Conduct regular training sessions for the incident response team to enhance their technical skills and familiarity with server hardware, enabling quicker identification and resolution of issues.
